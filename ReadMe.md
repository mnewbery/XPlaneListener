The purpose of this project is to create a UDP listener and interpret xPlane packets for a selection of values:
Lattitude
Longitude
Pitch
Roll
Heading
Ground Speed
Height AMSL
Height AGL

The listener is highly configurable in terms of IP address and port number plus the output can be captured to 
identify the raw packets.

Once the listener is started, the values are output to a csv file for offline analysis

Big- and little-endian conversion is demonstrated and appears in the tests"# XPlaneListener"
